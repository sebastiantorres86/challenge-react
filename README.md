This component was created as a submission to a [educabot.com](https://educabot.com/) challenge. The exercise consists of the implementation of a component as provided by the designer. The layout provided shows all possible states and the different sizes that must be implemented.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

Once you run this, npm will begin the installation process of all of the current project's dependencies.

`npm run storybook`

It will start Storybook locally and output the address. Depending on your system configuration, it will automatically open the address in a new browser tab and you'll be greeted by a welcome screen.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
